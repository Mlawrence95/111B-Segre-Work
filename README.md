# 111B Python Files
A series of files supporting the processing of data using common Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib within the Jupyter framework. 

The purpose of these files is to give UC Berkeley physics students a point of reference in performing their junior/senior lab analysis work, as well as to provide a Python framework for more experiments traditionally limited to Matlab. Some work is to support staff (evaluate feedback by creating structure). This is part of my work as a Segre intern with UC Berkeley's physics department.

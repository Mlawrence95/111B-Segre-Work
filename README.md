# Python-Data-Processing-Tutorials
A series of tutorials on processing data in python within the Jupyter framework using common libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. 

The purpose of these tutorials is to give UC Berkeley physics students a point of reference in performing their junior/senior lab analysis work, as well as to provide a Python framework for more experiments traditionally limited to Matlab. This work is being completed as part of my work as a Segre intern with Berkeley's physics department.
